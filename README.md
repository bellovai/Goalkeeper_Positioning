# Goalkeeper_Positioning
GitHub repository for my master's thesis (for now only the jupyter.ipynb file is relevant)

# Next steps
### Done
- Create and share GitHub repository
- Create and share LaTeX template
- Create group library on Zotero
- Isolate 1v1 situations (including misses)
- Define "theoretical optimal goalkeeper position" in code
- Define "theoretical optimal goalkeeper position" in words (consider other togkp models too)
- Read GK positioning literature: dive radius, rules, theorems, (citations), look for authors
### To-do
- Deviation from TOGKP
- Deviation from average GKP
- Include forward dive
- Include reaction time

# Big picture
### 2D
- Without defenders
- With defenders
### 3D
- From lines to areas
### xG model
- Angle, distance, deviation from optimal position

# Keep in mind
- Consider existing work, logically explain relations to existing work, reason choices, create defensible work
- Create properly written thesis, people unfamiliar with the topic need to understand the thesis / outcome
